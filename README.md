# Weapon Detection

If you are trying to clone this repository, then you also need to download yolo V3 cgf file and yolo V3 weights file seperately and place them together with the other files 
of this repository.

Do change the file path for yolo V3 weights and yolo V3 cfg file in the weapon_detection.py file and then run the code.

Happy Coding...😊😊👍👍
